# integration

> Under construction (PMS integration PR 1). Sections marked _(planned)_ land in later tasks.

**Purpose:** connects a workspace to an external shop management system (PMS) and mirrors its catalog,
stock and customers into Rapiz. KiotViet is the first provider; for linked records the PMS is the source of
truth (ADR-017, spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-11-01-pms-kiotviet-design.md`).

**Owned tables:** `integration_*` tables (schema in `packages/db/src/schema/integration.ts`) _(persistence planned)_.

**Public API (`api/`):**

- `INTEGRATION_FACADE` → `IntegrationFacade` _(use cases planned)_
- HTTP and DTOs: `packages/contracts/src/integration/` _(controller planned)_
- Events: none yet.

**Depends on:** the `commerce` (`CATALOG_SYNC_FACADE`), `crm` and `workspace` facades. Nothing depends on
`integration` (tier 3, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §3).

**Events consumed:** none.

**Invariants:**

- `domain/` is pure: KiotViet → catalog mapping (`kiotviet-mapping.ts`: one product per master, master is
  variant position 0, children by id; the unit joins the variant name only when a group has several units;
  a lone unnamed variant keeps the product form's empty name), sale-branch stock (`stock.ts`: Σ max(0,
  onHand − reserved), missing branches count 0), webhook signature (`signature.ts`, constant-time HMAC-SHA256)
  and store-name parsing (`retailer.ts`).
- Connect errors are 400 `VALIDATION_FAILED` with `details.reason` (`kiotviet_auth`, `kiotviet_retailer`,
  `kiotviet_permission` + `missing`); an unreachable KiotViet is 503 `UNAVAILABLE`.
- Never log secrets, tokens or customer data: log codes and counts (rule 07).

**Do not:** read `commerce`/`crm` tables (use their facades); put HTTP, Zod or Drizzle types in `domain/`.

**Test:** `pnpm --filter @agent-sales/backend test -- integration`
